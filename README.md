# Double-Dragon-Game
🎮 Double Dragon – SDL C Remake

This is a small project where I tried to recreate the classic Double Dragon game using C + SDL2.
It’s basically a fan-made clone I built while learning how 2D games work under the hood — game loops, rendering, input, collisions, etc.
I made this mainly for fun and practice, so the code isn’t “studio perfect,” but it works and shows how a simple beat-’em-up can be put together.


⭐ What’s Inside

Enemy AI (they chase/attack you… )
SDL2 graphics + rendering
Player movement, punches, kicks, and enemy interactions
Sprites, animations, sound effects
Mostly clean C code with headers split out


▶️ How to Run

You’ll need SDL2, SDL2_image installed.
Then just:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  make all (The Makefile Is already All SET UP )
  Enjoy the Game and Bring Back the Childhood Vibes ...



⚠️ Note

This is just a fan project made for learning.
Double Dragon belongs to its original creators — this is not official or commercial.



THANK YOUUUUU :>
